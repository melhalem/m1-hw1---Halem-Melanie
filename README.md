# About Me #
My name is Melanie Halem. I am passionate about the environment and communications, and I want to use my expertise to find and forward climate solutions. I love creating and consuming art, whether it be paintings, drawing, writing, or poetry. I just returned home to the United States after living in Madrid, Spain for the last two years, where taught Spanish elementary students. I am about to move to San Francisco, California, where I plan to begin my career in communications. 

# Past Coding Experience #
I have very little coding experience. In undergrad, I obtained a degree in mathematics. In one math class, I had to learn and code mathematical functions and matrices with R. I found coding mathematical equations to be easier than coding websites, but I am eager to rise to the challenge. I have never worked in terminal, VS Code, or GitHub before. It is a new world!

# Career Goals #
1. Work on the communications or research team to get a piece of environmental legislation passed in the United States.
2. Use art to inspire someone to act. 
3. Become an expert in the field of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
4. Get paid one time to make art.
